# Your First Web Page!

Create a new `.html` file and type or paste in the content below.

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

Save the file as `index.html` and open it in a web browser.

This is a very basic HTML document. The HTML tags `<HTML>` identify this document as a html document. The body tags `<body>` enclose the content that will be visible on the page. You should see just the text “Hello World!” The browser has translated the HTML tags and returned only the text.
