# Application

Now it’s your turn to apply what you’ve learned. The lab procedure introduced the basic tools you need to begin building a website. You are encouraged to extend your work by consulting the W3Schools HTML and CSS tutorials and documentation.

If you use outside resources, **cite them**. A simple list of URLs is sufficient. You may reuse or adapt the HTML/CSS you created earlier in the lab.

## Required Components

Your website must meet the following minimum requirements.

| Category | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| Theme | Create a personal website that introduces you. Possible focuses include academics, hobbies, clubs, family, or pets. Choose a focus that helps present who you are. |
| Landing Page | Create a landing page named `index.html` that introduces you and briefly describes the purpose or content of your site. |
| Additional Page | Include at least one additional HTML page beyond `index.html`. |
| Internal Link | Include at least one internal link from `index.html` to your additional page. |
| External Link | Include at least one external link from any page on your site to a different website. |
| Image | Include at least one image on any page, and provide appropriate `alt` text for accessibility. |
| Style & Formatting | Use CSS that contains at least two declarations and is applied across multiple pages to create a consistent visual style. |

These are minimum requirements. You are encouraged to be creative and go beyond them.

W3Schools provides helpful tutorials and examples for HTML and CSS, including menus, tables, and layout techniques:

- **HTML:** http://www.w3schools.com/html/  
- **CSS:** http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp  

You may adapt code or styles you find online, but you must credit your sources by linking to them. Experiment and explore different design ideas.

## How to Submit

1. Place all website files in a single Google Drive folder.  
2. Verify that sharing permissions allow your instructor to view the folder.  
3. Submit the Google Drive folder link on Canvas.
