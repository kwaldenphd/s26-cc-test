# Additional Pages

So far, we have created a single web page. To build a full website, we will likely want multiple pages of linked content.  

Let’s create a second `.html` file in the **same folder** as `index.html` and save it as `page2.html`.  

To get started, you can copy the HTML from `index.html` so that your new page is a well-formed and valid HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

## <i class="fa-solid fa-clipboard-question" aria-hidden="true"></i> Application

Add some content to your second page using:

* A title with the `<title>` tag
* A main heading with `<h1>`
* One or more paragraphs with `<p>`

This will give your second page a basic structure and content.
