In this chapter, we're going to look at aspects of `I/O` that have to do with reading and writing files, with a focus on two key data structures:
- Tabular data, or data stored as a table consisting of rows and columns
- Data stored as name-value pairs, specifically in the JavaScript Object Notation (`.json`) format

We can connect these two types of data structures back to the concepts of linear and associative arrays covered previously in the course. A quick refresher:
- "In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key...The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array" ([Wikipedia, "Array (data structure)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_(data_structure))")
- Associative arrays are "an abstract data type that stores a collection of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection" ([Wikpedia, Associative Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array))
