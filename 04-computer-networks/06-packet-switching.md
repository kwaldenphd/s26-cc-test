# Packet Switching Network Relay

Groups simulate a packet switching network to assemble a puzzle. This activity is configurable for a variety of group sizes or configurations.

Lots of options for what constitutes the data packets!

## <i class="fa-solid fa-gears" aria-hidden="true"></i> Setup

You will need the following roles:
- Computer hosts (at least 2, sending & recieving)
  * Responsible for giving the packets initial instructions and/or interpreting the reconstituted packet
- TCP/IP (at least 2, sending & recieving)
- Routers (at least 2)

| role | # needed | description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| computer host | at least 2 (sending/recieving) | responsible for giving the packets initial instructions and/or interpreting the reconstituted packet |
| TCP/IP | at least 2 (sending/recieving) | responsible for translating or reconstituting the packets once they arrive at a final destination |
| router | at least 1 | responsible for directing packets through the network from their source to final destination |
| packet | at least 1 | responsible for moving packets through the network based on the instructions from the routers. This role can help the TCP/IP role reassemble the packet once all components have arrived at the final destination |

If additional roles are needed, expand the number of routers or packets.

There are lots of options for what will constitute the data packets. This activity uses puzzle pieces as the data packets. A variety of jigsaw puzzle template vector images are freely available online.
- A DIY option is printing an image or design on cardstock and cutting with an exacto knife
- Another potion would be a children's puzzle (12 pieces is a good size)
- Blank puzzles would allow creating a unique design
- More sophisticated options could include using a cricut machine or laser cutter to create unique custom designs

When simulating a packet-switching network....
- The computer host roles are responsible for giving the packets initial instructions and/or interpreting the reconstituted packet
- The TCP / IP roles are responsible for translating or reconstituting the packets once they arrive at a final destination
- The router roles are responsible for directing packets through the network from their source to final destination.
  * NOTE: Each leg of the network (or `hop`) can only support one packet at a time. If needed, packets can bottleneck and queue.
- The packet roles are responsible for moving packets through the network based on the instructions from the routers. This role can help the TCP/IP role reassemble the packet once all components have arrived at the final destination.

Step #1: Groups form and decide on roles

Step #2: Run through a packet-switching simulation to get your network's packets from a sending host to a recieving host. A couple notes:
- Each leg of the network (or `hop`) can only support one packet at a time. If needed, packets can bottleneck and queue.
- This is note a race. Work together to try to understand the individual roles as well as how they work together.

Step #3: Once packets have arrived at the destination, assemble your puzzle.

If time allows: Rotate roles and run the simulation a few more times so everyone has a chance to be...
- A computer host or TCP/IP
- A router
- A packet

```{admonition} For Instructors
If it makes sense, you can frame this version of the activity as a type of `local area network` (LAN)
```

### Large Group Version

If time and size allow, groups can combine to form a more complex network. 

```{admonition} For Instructors
If it makes sense, you can frame this version of the activity as a type of `wide area network` (WAN)
```

When working in this configuration, facilitators will need to clarify how IP addressing will work.
- One option is creating a scenario (sending an email, sharing a document, etc) that establishes clear sending & recieving roles 
- Another option is using IP addresses to establish sending & recieving roles 

Depending on the space configuration, it may be advisable for hosts to be on the perimeter, TCP/IP roles to be on the perimeter, in front of their hosts. Router roles should be distributed throughout the space.

Step #1: Clarify roles and logistics

Step #2: Run through a packet-switching simulation to get your group's packets from a source computer host to a destination computer host. A couple notes:
- Each leg of the network (or `hop`) can only support one packet at a time. If needed, packets can bottleneck and queue.
- This is note a race. Work together to try to understand the individual roles as well as how they work together.

Step #3: Once packets have arrived at the destination, assemble your puzzle.

If time allows: Rotate roles and run the simulation a few more times so everyone has a chance to be...
- A computer host or TCP/IP
- A router
- A packet

```{danger} Disruption!
Want to add a real-world element to your simulation? Consider giving individuals (or a group) the power to disrupt. A few possibilities...
- Damage to a deep sea cable takes out a 3 routers 
- Fire takes out 3 routers
- Extreme heat takes out a local-area network 
- Political protests cause a state actor to shut down the wide-area network
```
