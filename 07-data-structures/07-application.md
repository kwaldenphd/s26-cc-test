## Application Questions

**Q1: Write a program that converts integer, float, or boolean values to a string, using the `str()` function.**

**Q2: Write a program that prompts the user to enter a 6-letter word, and then prints the first, third, and fifth letters of that word.**

**Q3: Modify the program provided below to search for the character `q` or `u` in the string. Does it always return the index number you expect? What index is returned if you ask for the index of the letter u (i.e., what happens when the desired character appears more than once in the string)?**

**Q4: Write a program that creates a list of numbers. Use the arguments and syntax presented in this section of the chapter to include code in your program that answers the following questions:**
- What is the length of your list?
- What is the number position for each of the items in your list?
- How would you return the value of the first item?
- How would you return the value of the last item?

Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code.

**Q5: Modify your Q4 program (working with the same list), using arguments and syntax covered in this section of the chapter to accomplish the following tasks:**
- Add a new item to your list
- Delete an item from your list
- Sort your list in-place
- Generate a sorted version of your list
- Reverse your list in-place
- Determine the min and max values for your list

Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code.

**Q6: Write a program that creates a dictionary on a topic of your choosing. Include at least 5 key-value pairs. Use arguments and syntax covered in this section of the chapter to accomplish the following tasks:**
- Add a new element to your dictionary
- Update or modify an element in your dictionary
- Print a list of all the keys in your dictionary
- Print a list of all the values in your dictionary

Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code.

**Q7: Describe the five data structures covered in this chapter (strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets) in your own words. How are they similar? What are key differences? What kinds of tasks/contexts/problems would benefit from specific structures?**
- NOTE: You are welcome to include code as part of this answer, but a code component is not required.

# *For these last two questions, you can use any of the data structures and arguments/syntax presented in this lab. As part of your answer, include a brief explanation for why you choose a particular data structure for the task.*

**Q8: Write a program that asks a user to input their current or former Notre Dame residence hall and returns or outputs that hall's mascot ([link to table with list of halls and mascots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame_residence_halls#List)).**

Sample output for this program:

```
Howard Hall's mascot is ducks!
```

Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code, as well as a brief explanation for the data structure/approach you chose for this program.

**Q9: In a previous chapter, you wrote a program that asks the user to enter a color value and returns an output message indicating whether the color is a primary, secondary, or tertiary color (using a combination of the `input()` function, comparison operators, `if-then-else` logic, and Boolean logical operators).**

Primary colors:
- Red
- Yellow
- Blue

Secondary colors:
- Green
- Orange
- Purple

Tertiary colors:
- Amber
- Vermillion
- Magenta
- Violet
- Teal
- Chartreuse

Let's revisit and rewrite this program- how could you approach this task using the data structures and syntax presented in this lab?

Answer to this question includes program + comments that document process and explain your code, as well as a brief explanation for the data structure/approach you chose for this program.
